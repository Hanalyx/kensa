"""Rule dependency ordering and conflict detection.

This module provides topological sorting of rules based on dependency
relationships (depends_on, conflicts_with, supersedes).

Example:
    >>> from runner.ordering import order_rules, OrderingResult
    >>> result = order_rules(rules)
    >>> if result.cycles:
    ...     print(f"Circular dependencies: {result.cycles}")
    >>> for rule in result.ordered:
    ...     print(rule["id"])
